# Rules:
# The server should accept any connection
# It should be a sort of "chat room"
# All responses from one client should be sent back to all other clients except the one who sent it
# There should be a list of connected clients
# I can decide when and how to disconnect clients
# one bot should take response from command line
# The bots are not the first to speak, but they will always respond
